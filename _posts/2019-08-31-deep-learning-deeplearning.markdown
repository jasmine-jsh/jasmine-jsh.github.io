I came to [KAIST][KAIST] to learn deeply about Deep Learning after working as a data analyst in [Samsung Electronics][Samsung Electronics] (2016-2020).

My job was about analyzing data and developing AI service. When making a recommendation model for home appliances, we were challenged to use Deep Learning model. It is a black box, which means deep learning networks are inherently unexplainable. This might cause damage to clothes, excessive energy consumption, and any unexpected problems. Eventually, we might get a huge number of VOCs and product recalls which could lead to the setbacks of business.


Currently, my major research interest is Explainable AI (XAI), to make decisions of significance with its explainability to satisfy issues of trust, compliance, verifiability, and understandability. AI field requires a wide range of background knowledge from linear algebra to network architecture as well as implementation skills based on TensorFlow or PyTorch.

A long, long way to go!
